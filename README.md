# rubikscube

A bad rubiks cube webapp I made using vue.js and three.js I guess

## Running locally

just like a standard vue app, run `yarn install` to first fetch the dependencies, `yarn serve` for serving the website locally with hot-reloading, `yarn build` for building the app with minified code, just small difference is that this is set up for github pages, so the website generated by `yarn build` would expect requests coming from `https://[url]/rubikscube/`, but I guess you can also run `yarn build --mode development` to bypass that config
